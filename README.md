## How to Use

To use my blog, you need to first sign in with your Google account. After signing in, you can now read some of my blogs and can write new blogs for the website. These posts are stored in Firebase and whenever a new post is made, the user will always be anonymous.

In the web app, you can sign in from the "Sign in" button on the top right. This will then ask you to sign in via your Google account. After signing in, you will now have the ability to create a new post via the "New Article" button. There, you can type in your post with a required Title and Body input fields. If either one of them is not filled and you hit "Submit," then you'll receive an error. Otherwise, these inputs are now saved into Firebase and a new blog post has been made public. The user can also choose to cancel it, with a warning message if the user choose to leave with either input fields containing some value.

When you are making a post, the sidebar navigation where all the blogs the users have made is hidden. Otherwise, it will always be available for all users to use at any time. If the user wants to go back to the welcome page, the user can click on "Undalevein's Blog" and return back to the main welcome post.

Once the user has finished, the user can hit "Sign Out" to sign out of their Google account in this web app.
